### Another TKL keyboard PCB

#### Notes for rev 2

Place diodes for keys "backspace" and "prtsc" on bottom of PCB

Use capacitors with a diameter below 4.5mm for C27, C26, C5, especially when putting them on the top side of the PCB.

The blue cathode pin of the LED for the key "pause" is not connected to anything. Connect it to the blue cathode pin of the LED for the key "scroll lock".
